# Animal Crossing FOSS
Welcome to the Animal Crossing FOSS Github page! We may choose to move away from Github in the future, in which case this site will no longer be updated and a link will be accessable here.

## What is it?
Animal Crossing originally released in Japan for the Nintendo 64DD (which never made it's way overseas) as a life simulation game with animals. The game includes mundane and ordinary tasks that any other way would be boring, but presents them in a fun way. After the Gamecube's launch, Nintendo released the game in North America for the first time.

## Why is this a thing?
Animal Crossing is a brilliant game that is a whole lot of fun, yes, but the ability to modify it in any way gives the developer a new type of power that they have never had before.

## Is this illegal?
Ehhhh....probably not? The project consists of only assets created by the [It Came From The Gamecube](https://www.videotoaster.neocities.org/itcamefromthegamecube "The project website") team, meaning that all models, textures, and other objects are created by us and should be considered fair use. **HOWEVER:** we are using Nintendo's original IP and are subject to copyright. Frequent backups of the source code are to be made in case of DMCA takedown.

### What's the DMCA?
